# SS 21054 (Area Measurement) - Why it matters for Villas

**What is it?**
The standard for measuring "How big is the house?". It distinguishes between:
*   **BOA (Boarea):** Living Area (measured inside walls).
*   **BTA (Bruttoarea):** Gross Area (measured outside walls).
*   **BYA (Byggnadsarea):** Footprint (bird's eye view).

**Relevance to KGVilla:**
*   **Accuracy:**
    *   Flooring cost is based on **BOA**.
    *   Foundation/Roof cost is based on **BYA** (Footprint).
    *   Painting cost is based on Wall Area (Perimeter x Height).
*   **Mistake Prevention:** If we mix these up, we could underprice the foundation by 15% (the thickness of the walls).

**Key AI Check:** "Calculate Foundation based on Outer Perimeter (BTA). Calculate Parquet based on Inner Perimeter (BOA)."
