# PBL (Plan- och bygglagen) - Why it matters for Villas

**What is it?**
The Swedish Planning and Building Act. It is the law that governs *permission* to build. It is distinct from BBR (which governs *how* to build).

**Relevance to KGVilla:**
*   **Mandatory Roles:** You generally cannot build a villa without a **Certified Inspection Manager (Kontrollansvarig - KA)**. This is a person you must hire (not the builder).
*   **Mandatory Meetings:**
    *   *Tekniskt Samråd:* A meeting with the municipality before starting.
    *   *Slutsamråd:* A meeting before moving in.
*   **Fees:** The municipality charges for the permit (Bygglov) AND for these meetings (Planavgift).

**Key AI Check:** "Is this a new build? Add ~25,000 kr for KA and ~40,000 kr for Municipal Fees."
