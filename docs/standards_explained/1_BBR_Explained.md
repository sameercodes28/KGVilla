# Boverkets Byggregler (BBR) - Why it matters for Villas

**What is it?**
The legal rulebook for construction in Sweden. It focuses on *functional requirements* (what the building must achieve) rather than specific solutions.

**Relevance to KGVilla:**
*   **Accessibility (Chapter 3):** This is the #1 reason floor plans get rejected. The AI checks if bathrooms and hallways are wide enough for wheelchairs.
*   **Fire (Chapter 5):** Villas must prevent fire spread to neighbors and allow escape. The AI checks window sizes for escape routes.
*   **Energy (Chapter 9):** Sets the insulation standard. We assume "Standard" walls (260mm) to meet these U-values.

**Key AI Check:** "Is the bathroom 1.7m x 1.9m?" (The unspoken rule for meeting accessibility).
