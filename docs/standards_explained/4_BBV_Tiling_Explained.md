# BBV (Byggkeramikrådets Branschregler) - Why it matters for Villas

**What is it?**
The specific rules for **Tiled Wet Rooms**. Since most modern villas use tiles (Kakel/Klinker) instead of plastic mats, this is the standard to follow.

**Relevance to KGVilla:**
*   **Hidden Costs:** BBV requires a very specific wall structure (plywood reinforcement + humid board) that costs **3x more** than a normal wall.
*   **Waterproofing:** Requires a "Foil System" (expensive), not just "roll-on goo" (cheap/old style).

**Key AI Check:** "If Room == Bathroom -> Use 'BBV Wall Assembly' price (4,200 kr/m²)."
