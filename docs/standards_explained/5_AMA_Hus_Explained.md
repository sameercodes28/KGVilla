# AMA Hus (Allmän Material- och Arbetsbeskrivning) - Why it matters for Villas

**What is it?**
The "Recipe Book" for construction. It defines quality levels (Class A, B, C).

**Relevance to KGVilla:**
*   **Pricing Baseline:** We assume "AMA Hus Class B" (Standard Residential).
*   **Workmanship:** It dictates how many screws to use, how flat the floor must be, and how to join vapor barriers. This drives the *labor* portion of our unit prices.

**Key AI Check:** None explicit, but our Unit Prices are calibrated to AMA Class B labor efforts.
