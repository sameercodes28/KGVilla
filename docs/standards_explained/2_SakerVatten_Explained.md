**What is it?**
Industry rules for plumbing. Adhering to this is essentially mandatory because insurance companies demand it. If you don't follow it and get a leak, you get $0.

**Relevance to KGVilla:**
*   **Cost Driver:** It mandates expensive systems like "Pipe-in-Pipe" (to reveal leaks) and "Leakage Trays" under kitchen appliances.
