# SWEDISH CONSTRUCTION MASTERCLASS
*Everything a Developer Needs to Know to Price a Villa in Sweden*

## 1. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK (Why we build the way we build)

### **BBR (Boverkets Byggregler)** - The Law
Think of BBR as the "Constitution". It sets the *functional requirements*.
*   **Accessibility is King:** If a wheelchair cannot turn around (1.30m circle) in the bathroom, the house is illegal.
*   **Fire Safety:** A garage attached to a house must be a separate "Fire Cell" (EI 30). This means double gypsum layers and expensive doors.
*   **Energy:** Walls must be thick (~260mm) to meet U-value standards.

### **PBL (Plan- och bygglagen)** - The Process
*   **The KA (Kontrollansvarig):** You cannot build without one. This is an independent inspector you must hire (~25k-40k SEK).
*   **Permits:** A building permit (Bygglov) is just the start. You need a "Startbesked" to dig and a "Slutbesked" to move in.

### **ABT 06 vs AB 04** - The Contract
*   **ABT 06 (Totalentreprenad):** The standard for consumers. The builder does Design + Build.
    *   *Impact:* Builder takes the risk -> Prices are **10-15% higher** to cover unknowns.
*   **AB 04 (Utförandeentreprenad):** Client provides drawings. Builder just builds.
    *   *Impact:* Cheaper upfront, but YOU pay for every mistake in the drawings.

## 2. THE HIDDEN STANDARDS (Why costs are higher than you think)

### **Säker Vatten** - The Plumbing Bible
Insurance companies demand this.
*   **No Hidden Joints:** You cannot hide a pipe connection in a wall. You must use "Pipe-in-Pipe" (Rör-i-Rör) systems that leak safely into a cabinet.
*   **Kitchen Safety:** Dishwashers and Fridges MUST have leakage trays (Läckageskydd) underneath.

### **BBV (Byggkeramikrådets Branschregler)** - Wet Rooms
*   **The "Expensive Wall":** You cannot just tile on gypsum. You need:
    *   15mm Plywood (for screw strength)
    *   Humid Board (Våtrumsskiva)
    *   Foil System (Waterproofing)
    *   Tiles
    *   *Result:* A bathroom wall costs **3x** more than a bedroom wall.

### **SS 436 40 00** - Electrical
*   **Zones:** You cannot put a socket in the shower (Zone 0). You need specific IP-rated sockets near it (Zone 2).
*   **Heavy Loads:** An induction hob needs a specific 3-phase feed (Perilex).

### **SS 21054** - Measuring Area
*   **BOA (Living Area):** Measured inside the walls. Use this for flooring/paint.
*   **BYA (Building Area):** The footprint. Use this for the foundation/roof.
*   *Trap:* If you order a foundation based on BOA, it will be too small.

## 3. THE 2025 REALITY CHECK (Market Conditions)

### **The "Shock" Costs**
*   **Connection Fees:** Electricity and Water grids are upgrading. Fees are up **30-35%** in regions like Stockholm.
*   **Climate Declaration:** A new law requires you to calculate the CO2 footprint of the building. This adds ~20k SEK in admin fees.

### **Regional Differences**
*   **Stockholm:** High labor, extreme connection fees.
*   **Västra Götaland (Göteborg):** Moderate fees, slightly lower labor.
*   **Rural:** Low labor, but potentially massive connection fees if the grid is far away.

## 4. HOW OUR AI WORKS (The "Logic Recipe")

When the AI looks at a floor plan, it follows this **Chain of Thought**:

1.  **Identify the Room:** "I see a toilet symbol -> It's a Bathroom."
2.  **Apply the Recipe:** "Bathroom requires **BBV Wall Assembly** (Expensive) + **Säker Vatten Plumbing** (Floor Drain + Waterproofing)."
3.  **Measure:** "Inner perimeter is 12m."
4.  **Calculate:** `12m * 2.5m height = 30m2 wall`.
5.  **Price:** `30m2 * 4,200 kr (Unit Price) = 126,000 kr`.
6.  **Add Markup:** "Add 12% for ABT 06 Risk + 25% VAT."

This ensures the price isn't a guess—it's a calculated construction bid.
