# Säker Vatteninstallation 2021:2 (Updated July 2024)

## Overview
"Säker Vatten" is the industry standard for plumbing. While not a law, insurance companies **will not pay out** for water damage if these rules are not followed. It is effectively mandatory.

## Key Updates (July 2024)

### 1. Distribution Cabinets (Fördelarskåp)
**Change:** Bottom mounting height requirements removed; focus is now on **testing** (SP method 5676).
**Impact:** We must spec "Säker Vatten compliant" cabinets in our BoQ. Cheap imports are not allowed.

### 2. Leakage Indication
**Rule:** Every concealed joint (connection) must have a leak indicator that drains into a room with a floor drain.
**Impact:** 
- **Cost:** Requires "pipe-in-pipe" (rör-i-rör) systems.
- **Quantities:** We need to calculate extra length for the protective outer pipe.

### 3. Kitchen Safety
**Rule:** Dishwashers and Fridges/Freezers with water/ice makers must have a **waterproof tray (läckageskydd)** underneath.
**Impact:** These trays must be line items in the "Kitchen" phase cost.

### 4. Pipe Penetrations (Genomföringar)
**Rule:** Strict rules on how pipes enter a bathroom floor/wall to ensure the waterproof membrane (tätskikt) is not compromised.
**Impact:** Cost of specific sealing collars (manschetter) must be included.

## Relevance to KGVilla
- **Material Choice:** Defaults must be "Pipe-in-Pipe" (PEX), not raw copper, for concealed runs.
- **Add-ons:** Automatically add "Leakage Tray" (Läckageskydd) whenever a "Dishwasher" or "Fridge" is detected on the plan.
