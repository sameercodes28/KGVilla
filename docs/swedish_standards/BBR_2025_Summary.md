# Boverket's Building Regulations (BBR) - 2025 Update Summary

## Overview
As of **July 1, 2025**, Sweden is transitioning from the traditional BBR to a new regulatory framework. This is a major shift from "detailed rules" to "functional requirements".

## Key Changes & Cost Implications

### 1. Functional Requirements
**Change:** The regulations now state *what* must be achieved (e.g., "The building must be energy efficient") rather than *how* to do it (e.g., "Wall U-value must be X").
**Impact:** 
- **Pros:** Allows for innovative materials and cost-saving designs if they can be proven to work.
- **Cons:** Requires significantly more documentation and "verification of competence" from the builder. **Project Management costs will rise.**

### 2. Stricter Fire Safety
**Change:** Enhanced requirements for fire cells and escape routes.
**Impact:** 
- **Costs:** Higher material costs for fire-rated gypsum and doors.
- **Design:** May require dedicated fire suppression systems in larger villas or specific layouts.

### 3. Accessibility (Tillgänglighet)
**Change:** Stricter enforcement of accessibility for bathrooms and entryways.
**Impact:** 
- **Floor Plans:** Bathrooms often need to be larger (min 1.7m x 1.9m clear space usually).
- **Costs:** Larger footprint = higher foundation and roof costs.

### 4. Energy Requirements (BBR 29 / Upcoming EU alignment)
**Change:** While specific energy targets are temporarily paused for EU alignment, the baseline remains high.
**Impact:** 
- **Windows:** Triple glazing (U-value < 0.9) is practically mandatory.
- **Insulation:** Wall thickness is increasing (standard 260-300mm).

## Relevance to KGVilla
Our AI must not just count walls; it must **validate** them:
- "Is this bathroom big enough for a wheelchair?" (Accessibility check)
- "Is there a fire door between the garage and the house?" (Fire safety check)
